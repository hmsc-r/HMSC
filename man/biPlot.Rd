\usage{
biPlot(
  hM,
  etaPost,
  lambdaPost,
  factors = c(1, 2),
  colVar = NULL,
  colors = NULL,
  spNames = hM$spNames,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hM}{a fitted \code{Hmsc} model object}

\item{etaPost}{posterior distribution of site loadings (Eta)}

\item{lambdaPost}{posterior distribution of species loadings
(Lambda)}

\item{factors}{indices of the two factors to be plotted}

\item{colVar}{the environmental covariate from XData according to
which the sites are to be coloured}

\item{colors}{controls the colors of the heatmap. For continuous
covariates, colors should be given as a name of palette, with
default value \code{colorRampPalette(c("blue","white","red"))},
or as a vector of colours. For factors, colors should be given
as a vector of colours, e.g. \code{c("blue","red")}.}

\item{spNames}{a vector of species names to be added to the
ordination diagram}

\item{\dots}{other parameters passed to the function.}
}
