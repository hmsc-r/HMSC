\usage{
plotGradient(hM, Gradient, predY, measure, index = 1, prob = c(0.025,
  0.5, 0.975), showData = FALSE, jigger = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Gradient}{an object returned by the function \code{\link{constructGradient}}}

\item{measure}{whether plotted is species richness ("S"), an individual species ("Y") or community-weighted mean trait ("T")}

\item{index}{which species or trait is plotted}

\item{prob}{quantiles of the credibility interval plotted}

\item{showData}{whether raw data are plotted as well}

\item{jigger}{the amount by which the raw data are to be jiggered in x-direction (for factors) or y-direction (for continuous covariates)}

\item{pred}{an object returned by applying the function \code{\link{predict}} to \code{Gradient}}
}
\value{
For the case of a continuous covariate, returns posterior probability by which the plotted variable is greater for the
 last sampling unit of the gradient than for the first sampling unit of the gradient. For the case of a factor, returns the plot object.
}
\description{
Plots an environmental gradient over one of the variables included in \code{XData}
}
\details{
For \code{measure}="Y", \code{index} selects which species to plot from \code{hM$spNames}.
For \code{measure}="T", \code{index} selects which trait to plot from \code{hM$trNames}.
Whith \code{measure}="S" plotted is the row sum of \code{pred},
and thus the interpretation of "species richness" holds only for probit models.
For Poisson models "S" shows the total count,
whereas for normal models it shows the summed response.
For \code{measure}="T",
in probit model the weighting is over species occurrences,
whereas in count models it is over individuals.
In normal models, the weights are exp-transformed predictors to avoid negative weights
