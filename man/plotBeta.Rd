}
\arguments{
\item{post}{Posterior summary of Beta parameters obtained from \code{\link{getPostEstimate}}}

\item{param}{Controls which parameter is plotted, current options include "Mean" for posterior mean estimate and "Support" for the level of statistical support measured by posterior probability for a positive or negative response}

\item{plotTree}{Logical. Whether species' environmental responses is to be mapped onto the phylogeny used in model fitting}

\item{SpeciesOrder}{Controls the ordering of species, current options are "Original", "Tree", and "Vector". If SpeciesOrder = "Vector", an ordering vector must be provided (see SpVector). If plotTree = T, SpeciesOrder is ignored}

\item{SpVector}{Controls the ordering of species if SpeciesOrder = "Vector". If a subset of species are listed, only those will be plotted. For alphabetic ordering, try \code{match(1:hM$ns, as.numeric(as.factor(colnames(hM$Y))))}}

\item{covOrder}{Controls the ordering of covariates, current options are "Original" and "Vector". If covOrder = "Vector", an ordering vector must be provided (see covVector)}

\item{covVector}{Controls the ordering of covariates if covOrder = "Vector". If a subset of covariates are listed, only those will be plotted}

\item{spNamesNumbers}{Logical of length 2, where first entry controls whether species names are added to axes, and second entry controls whether species numbers are added}

\item{covNamesNumbers}{Logical of length 2, where first entry controls whether covariate names are added to axes, and second entry controls whether covariate numbers are added}

\item{supportLevel}{Controls threshold posterior support for plotting}

\item{split}{If plotTree = T, controls the division of the plotting window between the tree and the heatmap.}

\item{cex}{Controls character expansion (font size). Three values, controlling covariate names, species names, and color legend axis labels}

\item{colors}{Controls the colors of the heatmap, default value \code{colorRampPalette(c("blue","white","red"))}}
}
\description{
Plots heatmaps of parameter estimates or posterior support values of species' environmental responses, i.e. how species in \code{Y} responds to covariates in \code{X}
